        <h3>Sushi is one of the best known Japanese foods around the world.</h3>
        <p>Sushi usually refers to a dish of pressed vinegared rice with a piece of raw fish or shellfish, called a <em>neta</em>, on top.</p>
        <p>Sushi is generally eaten with soy sauce and wasabi, but those who aren't too fond of wasabi can ask for <strong>"sabi-nuki"</strong></p>
